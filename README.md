# NBA Analytics & Predictive Modeling with LSTM

## Overview
This project leverages **machine learning (LSTM models)** and **business intelligence tools (Power BI)** to analyze and predict **NBA player rankings, team standings, and MVP candidates** based on historical data (2010-2024). By integrating deep learning and interactive dashboards, this system provides actionable insights for analysts, coaches, and basketball enthusiasts.

### **Key Features**
- **LSTM-Based Predictions:** Predicts **player performance, team standings, and MVP candidates** using time-series analysis.
- **Kobe Bryant Shot Selection Dashboard:** Analyzes Kobe Bryant’s shooting tendencies, efficiency, and decision-making.
- **Power BI Integration:** Enables **interactive visualizations** of player statistics, team performance, and historical trends.
- **Real-Time Analytics with Flask:** Deploys LSTM models within **Power BI’s Power Query Editor** for **real-time predictions**.
- **Data Processing & Feature Engineering:** Prepares **NBA datasets (sourced from Kaggle & official NBA statistics)** for accurate modeling.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Matplotlib
- **Flask**: Backend for real-time analytics
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Power BI integration)
- **Power BI** (Seperate Dashboard) : Visualization and dashboarding

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/VaishnaviUnnikrishnan/Dunklytics_NBA_Dashboard.git
   cd NBA_LSTM_Analysis
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

   ```
3. Run Flask application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. Load the Power BI dashboard and connect it to the Flask API for real-time predictions.

## Contribution Guidelines
