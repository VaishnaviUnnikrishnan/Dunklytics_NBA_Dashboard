Abstract
The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a league that generates a vast amount of statistical
data each season, encompassing player performance, team efficiency, and game trends.
Traditional methods of analyzing player and team performance often fail to capture intricate
patterns, limiting the ability of analysts, coaches, and enthusiasts to make data-driven decisions.
This project aims to bridge this gap by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques,
specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, to predict player rankings, team
standings, and potential MVP candidates based on historical data from 2010 to 2024. A dedicated
Kobe Bryant Shot Selection Dashboard is included to provide an in-depth analysis of his
shooting tendencies, efficiency, and decision-making process, offering valuable insights into one
of the greatest players in NBA history. The processed dataset, sourced from Kaggle and official
NBA statistics websites, undergoes data preprocessing and feature engineering to ensure
accuracy and consistency.
The integration of Power BI dashboards enhances the analytical experience by enabling
interactive visualizations of player statistics, team performances, and comparative analytics.
Furthermore, the LSTM model is deployed within Power BI’s Power Query Editor, allowing for
real-time predictions and seamless data-driven decision-making.By combining machine learning,
deep learning, and business intelligence tools, this project empowers analysts and basketball
professionals with actionable insights that improve team strategies, player scouting, and overall
game performance.
